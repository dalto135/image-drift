## Description
A static webpage that leverages OpenAI APIs to generate a series of images and prompts that naturally evolve over time. The user inputs a prompt that is used to generate an image using DALL E, that image is then inputed into GPT Vision to create a Generative AI prompt based on that image. The prompt can be used to generate a new image, creating a cascade of conceptually related images and prompts that subtly change over time.
